Title: Revealing the Path of an Online Request: Dissecting What Takes Place When You Type "https://www.google.com" and Press Enter

Ever wonder what complicated procedure goes into typing a simple online URL such as "https://www.google.com"  into your browser and hitting enter? Even while it seems like it happens instantly, there's a complicated series of procedures that take place to quickly link you to the target website. Let us take a step-by-step look at this mysterious journey:


DNS Request:
Upon hitting enter, your browser initiates a Domain Name System (DNS) request to a DNS server. This request converts the human-readable domain name "https://www.google.com" into an IP address, essential for locating the server hosting the website.

TCP/IP:
Your browser makes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to Google's server's IP address after the DNS server sends it. The majority of internet communication is based on TCP, which guarantees dependable, organized, and error-checked data transfer between devices via an IP network.

Firewall:
Before reaching the destination server, your request may encounter a firewall. Firewalls serve as a protective barrier between your computer and the internet, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They safeguard private networks from unauthorized access attempts.

HTTPS/SSL:
For increased communication security, the majority of websites, including Google, now use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) instead of HTTP. In order to protect privacy and maintain data integrity, HTTPS encrypts data transferred between your browser and the server using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), its successor.

Load-Balancer:
As one of the most heavily trafficked websites globally, Google utilizes load-balancing techniques. Incoming network traffic is split among several servers using load balancers, which keeps no one server from being overloaded. This tactic improves website performance and dependability while making the most use of available resources.


Web Server:
After navigating through the load balancers, your request finally reaches one of Google's web servers. The web server's primary role is to handle HTTP requests from clients (such as your browser) and deliver the requested web pages or resources.

Application Server:
In cases involving dynamic web content (e.g., Google search results), the web server may collaborate with an application server. The application server executes the necessary code (e.g., Python, Java, PHP scripts) to dynamically provide the requested content tailored to your particular query.

Database:
Applications that rely on large data repositories, like Google Search, frequently communicate with database servers using application servers. The search results you see are supported by massive amounts of organized or unstructured data (such as indexed web pages) that are stored and managed by the database server.

In essence, typing "https://www.google.com" and pressing enter sets in motion a journey involving DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, firewall traversal, HTTPS encryption, load balancing, interactions with web and application servers, and database access. These steps seamlessly collaborate to deliver the desired web content, making the internet appear swift and effortless from a user's perspective.
